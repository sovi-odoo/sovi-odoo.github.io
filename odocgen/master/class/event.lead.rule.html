Those are

* if a filter is set: filter registrations based on this filter. This is
done like a search, and filter is a domain;
* if a company is set on the rule, it must match event's company. Note
that multi-company rules apply on event_lead_rule;
* if an event category it set, it must match;
* if an event is set, it must match;
* if both event and category are set, one of them must match (OR). If none
of those are set, it is considered as OK;

:param registrations: event.registration recordset on which rule filters
will be evaluated;
:return: subset of registrations matching rules</pre></details><details><summary id="m-_run_on_registrations">_run_on_registrations(self, registrations) <span class="position">@ line 113</span></summary><pre>Create or update leads based on rule configuration. Two main lead
management type exists

* per attendee: each registration creates a lead;
* per order: registrations are grouped per group and one lead is created
or updated with the batch (used mainly with sale order configuration
in event_sale);

Heuristic

* first, check existing lead linked to registrations to ensure no
duplication. Indeed for example attendee status change may trigger
the same rule several times;
* then for each rule, get the subset of registrations matching its
filters;
* then for each order-based rule, get the grouping information. This
give a list of registrations by group (event, sale_order), with maybe
an already-existing lead to update instead of creating a new one;
* finally apply rules. Attendee-based rules create a lead for each
attendee, group-based rules use the grouping information to create
or update leads;

:param registrations: event.registration recordset on which rules given by
self have to run. Triggers should already be checked, only filters are
applied here.

:return leads: newly-created leads. Updated leads are not returned.</pre></details><script src="class.js"></script></body></html>
