``cancel`` should be overloaded instead of ``action_skip``. As with
``execute``, if it returns an action dictionary that action is
executed in stead of the default (going to the next configuration item)

The default implementation is a NOOP.

``cancel`` is also called by the default implementation of
``action_cancel``.</pre></details><details><summary id="m-execute">execute(self) <span class="position">@ line 60</span></summary><pre>Method called when the user clicks on the ``Next`` button.

Execute *must* be overloaded unless ``action_next`` is overloaded
(which is something you generally don't need to do).

If ``execute`` returns an action dictionary, that action is executed
rather than just going to the next configuration item.</pre></details><details><summary id="m-next">next(self) <span class="position">@ line 51</span></summary><pre>Reload the settings page</pre></details><ul id="m-start"><li>start(self) <span class="position">@ line 47</span></li></ul><script src="class.js"></script></body></html>
